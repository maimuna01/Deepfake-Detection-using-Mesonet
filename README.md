# Deepfake Detection Using MesoNet Architecture

This project focuses on detecting deepfakes in images using the MesoNet network architecture, which is specifically designed for identifying facial manipulations. The model leverages key deep learning frameworks including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and OpenCV for efficient processing and analysis.

## Frameworks and Tools:
- **TensorFlow**, **Keras**: For model development and training.
- **PyTorch**: Supporting model optimization and performance tuning.
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and manipulation tasks.

## Dataset Overview:

### Training Set:
- **Forged Images**: 5,111
- **Real Images**: 7,250

### Validation Set:
- **Forged Images**: 2,889
- **Real Images**: 4,259

### Balance:
- Both the training and validation sets maintain a balanced distribution between forged and real images. This balance ensures that the model is effectively trained to recognize deepfake patterns and generalize across different data scenarios.

## Purpose:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust detection framework that identifies deepfake images with high accuracy. By training the model on a diverse dataset, the system is validated for real-world deployment, providing a critical tool for cybersecurity and digital forensics.

## Key Features:
- **MesoNet Architecture**: A compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for detecting facial forgeries with precision.
- **Cybersecurity Application**: The system enhances the integrity of digital media by identifying manipulated content, safeguarding against threats like misinformation, identity theft, and fraud.
